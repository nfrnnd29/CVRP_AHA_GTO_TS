# CVRP_AHA_GTO_TS

This code provides MATLAB implementations of metaheuristic CVRP solvers on Augerat benchmark instances loaded from Excel (e.g., A-n32-k5, A-n33-k6, A-n36-k5). Customer sequences are represented as permutations derived by sorting continuous position vectors (randomized agent “positions” converted into visit orders), and route quality is evaluated through a CVRP objective function that decodes a permutation into capacity-feasible vehicle routes (vehicle capacity set to 100 in the scripts) and returns the total route cost along with per-vehicle route sequences for inspection. In addition to direct metaheuristic search, the repository includes a clustering-based initializer to improve starting solutions before applying evolutionary improvement.

The main solvers are: AHA_GTO_TS.m, which runs a large-population metaheuristic search (500 agents, 1000 iterations) to find a strong CVRP permutation and then applies a Tabu Search refinement step using a permutation action list, tabu tenure, and iterative best-move selection to further reduce total cost while logging best cost per iteration; CVRP_GWO_v5.m, which applies a Grey Wolf Optimizer (alpha/beta/delta hierarchy with coefficient updates) where each agent’s sorted position vector defines a candidate permutation evaluated each iteration and tracked via a convergence curve; and clustering_cvrp.m, which builds an initial solution using k-medoids clustering (k = number of trucks) on customer coordinates, injects the clustered route into a random population, and improves it with a Genetic Algorithm (tournament selection, single-point preservation crossover, permutation mutation) plus an embedded local improvement loop that repeatedly mutates the current best route. The auxiliary script test_v1.m is a visualization helper for clustering/centroid inspection on Augerat coordinates.
